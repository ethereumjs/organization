============
Contributing
============

Everyone is invited to contribute to the ``EthereumJS`` libraries (see also our 
:ref:`code_of_conduct`). These are some guidelines to help you get started!

Where to Contribute
===================

Picking up some Issues
----------------------
There are labelled issues on all our libraries, see e.g. the issue pages of the
`VM <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/labels/package%3A%20vm>`_ or the 
`Merkle Tree <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/labels/package%3A%20trie>`_
libraries, sorting issues on things like effort needed, priority or type.

Feel free to pick any issue you think is suitable for you to work on, then you
might also want to drop a note on the issue page that you are working on the
issue.

Some issues are also labelled with ``help wanted`` and/or ``good first issue``,
indicating that they are in particular suitable to get started.

Some generic Tasks
------------------

There are also various generic tasks which constantly needs help, you can also 
have a look at the :ref:`ongoing_work_tasks` section to get an overview here.

Many of these things are not listed as issues, but are nevertheless a good place
to start especially for new contributors. This includes:

- Improving on the documentation (see: :ref:`documentation`)
- Writing additional tests (see: :ref:`testing`)
- Updating library dependencies (see: :ref:`dependency_management`)

All these things are a good way to gently get in touch with the inner workings
of a library without directly have to manipulate production code directly.

How to Start
============

Introductory Information
------------------------

Once you have chosen what you want to work on you can actually grab your coffee,
take your laptop to a quiet place to work and start hacking! ðŸ˜„

Have a look at the :ref:`git_guidelines` and the :ref:`workflow_best_practices`
sections for some Git and overall work instructions being common practice within
the ``EthereumJS`` ecosystem.

The :ref:`technical_reference` chapter generally contains some overview information
on the development environment, programming language and tools used throughout
the libraries. Have a broader look on what is relevant for you to successfully 
work on your selected task.

Get in Touch
------------

Generally: just get in touch. Early on - see :ref:`contact` section. Feel free to
ask everything you need to know, there is no question which shouldn't been asked
and there will likely be someone who can give you some guidance along the way.
