Overview
========

``EthereumJS`` is the **JavaScript / TypeScript** project within the **Ethereum 
Foundation**. Work is mainly done within the following GitHub organization:

- https://github.com/ethereumjs

Our central repository is the `ethereumjs-monorepo <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo>`_ hosting a full featured `TypeScript` Ethereum VM implementation as well as
related packages like:

- Structural blockchain component representations like e.g. the 
  `block <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/block>`_ or
  `tx <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/tx>`_ packages
- The `common <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/common>`_
  package providing central access to chain and hardfork settings
- An `Ethash <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/ethash>`_
  implementation

Other noteworthy libraries out of the monorepo scope are e.g. an
implementation of the `Merkle Patricia Tree <https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree>`_,
the `RLP <https://github.com/ethereumjs/rlp>`_ serialization library or a widely used
`Util <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-util>`_ library providing utility functions for
things like hashing, signatures as well as helpers for address and account management.

Have a look at the organizational GitHub overview page linked above to get an impression of what
is currently being worked on as well as the libraries available.

Focus and related Projects
==========================

Main focus of ``EthereumJS`` is to provide high-quality and robust implementations
of *core Ethereum infrastructure technologies* (virtual machine), *protocols* (devp2p)
and *data structures* (merkle tree).

Other related projects you might want to check out as well are e.g.:

- `web3.js <https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/>`_ (Ethereum JavaScript API)
- `ethers.js <https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js>`_ (Ethereum Wallet implementation and library)
- `Truffle <https://github.com/trufflesuite>`_  (Development Framework)
- `embark <https://github.com/embark-framework/embark>`_ (dApp Framework)
- `Remix <https://github.com/ethereum/remix>`_ (https://github.com/ethereum/remix)

Most of the projects above also make use of some of our base-layer libraries.
``EthereumJS`` libraries are also used by various other actors within the ecosystem
like MetaMask, 0x or Augur.

Team and Contact
================

``EthereumJS`` is a strongly community-driven project and the active team is 
regarded as the sum of people actively contributing to the 
libraries, ongoing development is ensured by the JavaScript team from the
Ethereum Foundation.

For technical questions and getting in touch you can use our ``Discord`` 
server:

Organizational questions are centered and discussed on the ``organization`` repo:

Ongoing Work Tasks
==================

The following is an overview on ongoing work tasks to get an idea on the current
focus of work. This is also serving internal accounting purposes.

.. note::
   This list is focussing on reoccurring work tasks, for an overview on 
   dedicated new projects have a look at the :ref:`roadmap` section.


W1 - Virtual Machine Development
--------------------------------

One strong emphasis of ``EthereumJS`` work is on maintaining and further developing
a robust and up-to-date JavaScript virtual machine 
implementation (`ethereumjs-monorepo <https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo>`_).

Main tasks around this are:

- Updating the VM on new hardforks
- Targeting compliance with the latest `consensus test suite <https://github.com/ethereum/tests>`_ releases
- Implementing feature requests from the community (Truffle, Remix, others), e.g. to provide better debugging functionalities
- Ongoing refactoring work to open up new use cases

W2 - Library Modernization
--------------------------

``EthereumJS`` libraries provide robust and solid implementations serving the
dedicated purposes. Along there is an ongoing effort to integrate new
`Javascript` respectively `TypeScript` language feature and adopt to new coding
practices to provide the community with secure and easy-to-develop upon libraries
and APIs.

Some things done lately in this regard:

- Using ``ES6`` classes for structuring library components
- JavaScript ``Promise`` based interfaces (in contrast to ``callback`` logic)
- `TypeScript` transition of all major libraries
- Updating on security improving language features (block-scoped variables,...)
- Improving on code readability (destructuring of objects,...)


W3 - Bug Fixes and Maintenance
------------------------------

``EthereumJS`` libraries are widely used in production - often in security-sensitive
contexts - and there is an ongoing effort to keep libraries up-to-date and secure.

Main tasks around this:

- Fix bugs reported by the community in a timely fashion
- Keep library dependencies up-to-date
- Adopt libraries to various user work environments and build pipelines (browser, React,...)
- Be responsive to feature requests from the community

W4 - Testing and CI
-------------------

To provide a high level of reliability we target a high test coverage on all of our
libraries and writing new tests and integrating these in the everyday work process
(CI) is an ongoing effort.

Efforts include:

- Improve test coverage for library APIs
- Add and maintain integration tests (with a focus on browser testing)
- Integrate test runs / coverage reports into CI process
- Benchmark libraries, performance improvements for both library execution and tests


W5 - Community Work
-------------------

There is a high level of engagement from the community with the different 
``EthereumJS`` libraries and there are countless examples for both evolutionary
updates as well as high-quality and broadly scoped feature contributions from
the community.

We are determined to put substantial resources here to further support
exchange with and engagement from the community.

Related tasks are:

- Help onboard new contributors, give introductory guidance
- Review of Pull Requests
- Accompany community development work
- Management and structuring of issues and PRs
- Responsiveness on communication channels

W6 - Accessibility
------------------

Very much related to the community efforts (W5) is the goal of making libraries
generally as easily approachable as possible and so to lower the barrier to 
engage and minimize the need to do one-to-one explanations on how things work.

Tasks include:

- Provide up-to-date and consistent ``API`` documentation
- Instructions on environment setup and installation, developer docs
- Easy to recreate and up-to-date examples in ``README``
- Common standards and standard documentation (these docs :-)) whenever possible
- Easy to understand, modular and documented source code
